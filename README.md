# Udacity-Neighbourhood-Map
You will develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit.You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).

### Instructions to use
---

On the screen, you will see a map of Mumbai, India. A few interests of tourist locations are pre-selected.


1. Location can be selected by directly clicking on the map or by selecting from the top-left drop-down list.
2. After selecting the location, the location will get centered on the screen and a pop-up box with some information will appear above the location.
3. You can also narrow down the list of markers by typing in the search bar.
4. After selecting the  location, you can then click the bottom-left 'Flickr' icon. It will show you the photos relevant to the location selected... from the Flickr Photo Feed.

### Use of APIs
